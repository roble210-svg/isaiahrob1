Information about myself
About me
My name is Isaiah Robles, I am a student attending the University of Minnesota Duluth and I'm majoring in financial planning. I’m interested in learning how money flows and is handled in households and companies so I can better understand how to manage my own money, and eventually help other people plan carefully for the future while maintaining a healthy lifestyle in the present. 


Hobbie summary
I enjoy playing all sports with my friends like soccer, football, and basketball among other things. I'm involved in intramural sports for soccer and basketball and have done some flag football in the past.


I also enjoy running. This past summer I ran a half marathon in 1 hour and 30 minutes for my first race and I'm excited to see what I can do in the future.
